# TheWorld
----
A project created as I worked myself through a PluralSight course on MVC in Asp.net Core.
It covers subjects such as `EntityFramework`, basic `AngularJS`, `Bootstrap` (bleh),
`.NET core fundamentals`, `API` design and more.

### TODO:
----

1. Push to Azure
    - Keep project environment variables in "Development" until after fixed SSL.
2. Add email handling
